st.markdown("""

An Electric Vehicle (EV) two-wheeler is a sustainable and efficient mode of transportation that offers a greener alternative to traditional gasoline-powered two-wheelers. With an electric powertrain comprising an electric motor and battery pack, EV two-wheelers produce zero emissions, reduce air pollution, and operate silently. They provide a smooth and instant acceleration experience while offering cost savings through lower operational and maintenance costs. The growing market for EV two-wheelers is driven by increasing environmental concerns and government incentives, making them an appealing choice for eco-conscious individuals looking for a sustainable and economical mode of urban commuting and short-distance travel.
